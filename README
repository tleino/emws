emws - Embeddable WebSocket server

emws source files can be embedded to projects that wish to serve
content over the WebSocket protocol: see websocket.c for an example.

The files are not very useful as they are, but they can be used as
/an example/ of how to set up a server that supports the WebSocket
protocol.

Some caveats:

 - It is a quickly written proof of concept from about year 2015,
   needs a throughout clean up.

 - Writes debug file to current working directory (useful when
   testing out things, but needs to be removed from any real server).

 - Is not well configurable but need to change hardcoded strings.

 - Does not support multiple clients and exits after first client
   and this is because this is a simple example.
